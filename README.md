# Subtitle Combiner

This project provides a Python script to combine multiple SRT (SubRip Text) files into a single text file. This is useful for creating a transcript from a series of video lectures or for any other purpose where you need to consolidate subtitle information.

## Usage

1.  **Place your SRT files in the `srt_files` directory.**
2.  **Run the `combine_srt.py` script from the root of the project:**

    ```bash
    python combine_srt.py
    ```

3.  **The script will generate a file named `combined_subtitles.txt` in the root of the project.** This file will contain the combined text from all the SRT files, with each file's content separated by a header indicating the original filename.

4. **Use the following prompt to develop a learning plan.**  

Please analyze the provided subtitles from a lecture or series of lectures. Your goal is to create a clear and comprehensive learning plan that helps me understand the key concepts and major topics discussed.

The learning plan should include the following sections:

1.  **Major Topics and Sub-topics:** Identify the main themes and break them down into their constituent sub-topics. Use the information in the subtitles to structure this.
2.  **Key Definitions and Important Terms:** List and define the essential vocabulary introduced in the lecture.
3.  **Core Questions and Concepts:** Detail the central questions or ideas explored in the lecture.
4.  **Analogies and Examples:** Note any analogies or examples used to simplify complex topics.
